*This repository is intended as a technical and scientific showcase of the SGEMAS architecture.*




**SGEMAS** is a bio-inspired, thermodynamic anomaly detection architecture designed to solve the energy crisis **and enable Precision Medicine** in implantable medical devices (Pacemakers, ILRs). It replaces static Deep Learning models with a dynamic, self-organizing agent topology that remains dormant during homeostasis, **learns patient-specific physiology**, and only wakes up during pathological events.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The core algorithm is currently **Patent Pending**. This repository serves as a technical showcase and validation suite. The full implementation is deployed within our **SmartDiag** clinical platform.

## 🚀 The Innovation: "Wake-on-Crisis"

Unlike traditional AI that burns constant power (always-on), SGEMAS follows a metabolic principle:

*   **Dormancy ($N=1$):** 96% of the time, the system consumes negligible resources.
*   **Reaction ($N=39$):** It structurally recruits agents *only* when the signal entropy rises (e.g., Arrhythmia).

### 💡 What is an "Agent"? The 3 Perspectives

*   **📐 Mathematical:** A dynamic **Lagrangian Multiplier**. Each agent is an equation spawned to minimize local Free Energy ($F$) and cancel out the entropy of the anomaly.
*   **💻 Computational:** A **Just-in-Time Micro-Thread**. Unlike static Neurons, agents are ephemeral predictive kernels allocated dynamically. No anomaly = Zero memory usage.
*   **🧬 Biological:** A **Digital Immune Response**. Like white blood cells, agents are recruited massively from the bloodstream (memory) only when a pathogen (pathology) is detected to restore Homeostasis.

## 🔬 Scientific Validation

We validated the system on the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database** (N=48 Patients, Inter-patient Split).

### 1. Thermodynamic Phase Space
Pathologies are detected not just as statistical outliers, but as **physical ruptures** in the metabolic field.
